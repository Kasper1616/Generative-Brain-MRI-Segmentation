### Generative Medical Image Segmentation

This project aims to use Generative Medical Segmentation (GMS), which leverages a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform medical image segmentation by mapping image latent representations to mask latent representations. This project focuses on masking abnormalities in Brain MRI images, utilizing the Brain MRI segmentation dataset from Kaggle.
